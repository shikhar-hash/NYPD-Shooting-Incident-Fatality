# NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Fatality
##The NYPD Shooting Incident Fatality model leverages machine learning to predict the severity of shooting incidents based on historical data. By analyzing various factors such as location, time, and incident details, the model aims to enhance public safety through accurate predictions. Additionally, I have uploaded a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation and an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide a detailed overview of the analysis and insights derived from the data. These resources offer a visual and in-depth understanding of the model's performance and its real-world applications.
